# ‚úàÔ∏è Airline On-Time Performance Analysis

This project investigates airline on-time performance using a real-world dataset from the U.S. Department of Transportation, sourced via Kaggle. The dataset comprises detailed flight records between 2003 and 2008. As part of the STQD6324 Data Management course for Semester 2, 2024/2025, this analysis focuses on year 2007 and aims to uncover key insights into flight delays and cancellations.

The primary objective is to answer data-driven questions related to:

- Delay Patterns (time of day, day of the week, seasonal effects)

- Delay Factors (ranking the main causes of delay)

- Cancellation Analysis (exploring reasons and trends behind cancelled flights)

- Problematic Routes (identifying underperforming routes, carriers, and flight numbers)

We use Apache Hive to query large volumes of flight data efficiently and Python for visualization and analysis. All findings, queries, and visual outputs are documented in a reproducible Jupyter Notebook.

This project highlights the importance of data management skills in solving real-world transportation issues, improving flight reliability, and enhancing the overall passenger experience.
